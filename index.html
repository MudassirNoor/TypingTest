                                  tell you about a New Year's breakfast which I had when I was a
                                  little girl. What do you think it was? A slice of dry bread and
                                  an apple. This is how it happened, and it is a true story, every
                                  word. As we came down to breakfast that morning, with very shiny
                                  faces and spandy clean aprons, we found father alone in the
                                  dining-room. "Happy New Year, papa! Where is mother?" we cried.
