        <p id ="originalText">Dear Merrys:--As a subject appropriate to the season, I want to tell you
                              about a New Year's breakfast which I had when I was a little girl.
                              What do you think it was? A slice of dry bread and an apple. This is
                              how it happened, and it is a true story, every word.
                              As we came down to breakfast that morning, with very shiny faces and
                              spandy clean aprons, we found father alone in the dining-room.
                              "Happy New Year, papa! Where is mother?" we cried.</p>
